# Git App Privacy Policy

## Introduction  
Git App ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your data when you use the Git App.

## Data Collection  
Git App does not collect any personal information from users. We do not require any sensitive data such as names, emails, or passwords. The app solely interacts with the GitHub API to search for users, display their followers, following, and repositories.

## Usage Data  
The app does not track your usage behavior. We only display information fetched from the GitHub API, such as a user's profile, followers, following, and repositories. All actions are contained within the app and do not involve tracking your personal activity outside of the GitHub search functionality.

## Data Sharing  
Since no personal information is collected, we do not share, sell, or trade your data with third parties. Any information displayed within the app is fetched from the publicly available GitHub API.

## Security  
While the app does not store any user data, GitHub's own privacy and security measures apply when using their API. We recommend reviewing GitHub's privacy policy for further details on how they handle your data.

## Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect any changes. Any updates will be posted within the app or on the projectâ€™s official repository.
