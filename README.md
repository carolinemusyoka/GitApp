## UserFlow
The app shows a search screen, on the home page with a search bar. A user is able to search for a user using their username. The app displays the user's profile. When a user clicks on the profile, the app navigates to a detail screen, which displays the user's followers, following and repositories. 
When a user clicks on a repository, they are able to view the repository's description, stars, fork and watchers count and the topics under the repository.

## Architecture
The app is built using the MVVM architectural pattern. The app has composable screens that communicates to ViewModel which in turn communicates to
the usecase which communicates with Repository to get data.
